# React exercises

### Description

Hi! These are small react projects that I completed while learning React. I made them based on various tutorials, courses and as a part of infoshareAcademy frontend bootcamp (https://infoshareacademy.com/kurs/bootcamp-frontend/). There are also a few projects from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
