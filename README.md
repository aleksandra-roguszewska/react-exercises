# React exercises

### Description

Hi! These are small projects that I completed while learning React. I made them based on various tutorials, courses and as a part of [infoshareAcademy frontend bootcamp](https://infoshareacademy.com/kurs/bootcamp-frontend/), that I took part in this year. There are also a few projects from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

I also included 2 vanilla-JS projects and 1 html-css exercise here.
